# **Stock-Analysis with VBA**

## **Overview of Project**

##### As VBA is often used in the financial industry, I used nested loops in VBA to analyze alternative energy stocks and automate calculations. My objective was to find out if the manufacturer of silicon wafer panels, DAQO(DQ) is a good investment choice for my friend's parents. After running my analysis, I refactored the code to make it more efficient.

The analysis is well described with screenshots and code (4 pt).

## **Summary**

##### Refactoring code is the process of taking existing code and editing it without changing the function of the code.  Refactoring is useful and sometimes necessary to clean up the original code to make it more efficient to use in the future.   There are also disadvantages to refactoring code. In my case, after I refactored my code to analyse the stocks, I found many mistakes and errors.  It took a lot of time and testing. 

##### **Advantages**
- ##### Make it easier to understand for the next developer to use
- ##### Create a better quality code that is more maintainable, in case you want to add to it. 
- ##### Calculations may take less time to run 
 
##### **Disadvantages**
- ##### The time it takes to retest functionality after editing the code
- ##### After editing the code, bugs may be in the new code
